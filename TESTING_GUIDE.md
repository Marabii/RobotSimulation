# Testing Guide: Advanced Multi-Robot Delivery System

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the optimized multi-robot delivery system with dynamic battery management, enhanced infrastructure, and package handoff capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### **1. Immediate Performance Validation**
Test the system's core improvements with this simple command:

```bash
python3 test_robots.py specific 1 3 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- **1 robot:** ~43 steps, 100% success
- **3 robots:** ~93 steps, 100% success  
- **5 robots:** ~95 steps, 100% success

### **2. Fresh System Test**
Clear all previous results and run comprehensive testing:

```bash
python3 test_robots.py fresh
```

This will test configurations from 1-8 robots and generate performance plots.

## üìã Comprehensive Testing Options

### **Easy Testing Commands (test_robots.py)**

#### **Specific Robot Counts**
```bash
# Test exact robot configurations
python3 test_robots.py specific 1 2 3 4 5

# Test single robot (fastest validation)
python3 test_robots.py specific 1

# Test optimal configurations
python3 test_robots.py specific 1 5 8
```

#### **Range Testing**
```bash
# Test range of robots
python3 test_robots.py range 1 5

# Test extended range
python3 test_robots.py range 3 8
```

#### **Quick Validation**
```bash
# Test key configurations for validation
python3 test_robots.py quick
```

### **Advanced Testing Commands (run_robot_optimization.py)**

#### **Comprehensive Testing**
```bash
# Run all missing tests (default behavior)
python3 run_robot_optimization.py

# Force rerun all tests (ignore existing results)
python3 run_robot_optimization.py --force-rerun

# Clear results and start completely fresh
python3 run_robot_optimization.py --clear-results
```

#### **Targeted Testing**
```bash
# Test specific robot counts
python3 run_robot_optimization.py --specific-robots 1 3 5 8

# Test custom range
python3 run_robot_optimization.py --min-robots 2 --max-robots 6

# Test single configuration
python3 run_robot_optimization.py --specific-robots 5
```

## üîç What to Look For

### **Success Indicators**
1. **Delivery Completion:** All packages delivered successfully
2. **Reasonable Step Counts:** 40-100 steps for small configurations
3. **No Timeouts:** Simulations complete without getting stuck
4. **Battery Efficiency:** Robots operating at low battery levels
5. **Handoff Events:** Package transfers between robots (in multi-robot tests)

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Steps per Package:** Lower is better (efficiency)
- **Success Rate:** Should be 100% for all configurations
- **Simulation Time:** Should complete in seconds, not timeout
- **Battery Utilization:** Robots should use most of their battery before charging

### **Expected Output Examples**

#### **Successful Single Robot Test:**
```
Environment size: 20x20
Starting simulation with 3 robots and 1 packages
Robot0 took a package from A1 to deliver to goal 2 at position (15,0)
Robot0 has delivered the package at (14,1) near goal (15,0) and disappears.
=== SIMULATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ===
All 1 packages delivered in 43 steps
```

#### **Successful Multi-Robot Test:**
```
Environment size: 20x20
Starting simulation with 5 robots and 3 packages
Robot1 took a package from A1 to deliver to goal 2 at position (15,0)
Robot0 took a package from A1 to deliver to goal 2 at position (15,0)
Robot2 took a package from A3 to deliver to goal 1 at position (5,0)
Robot1 has delivered the package at (14,1) near goal (15,0) and disappears.
Robot0 has delivered the package at (14,1) near goal (15,0) and disappears.
Robot2 has delivered the package at (6,1) near goal (5,0) and disappears.
=== SIMULATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ===
All 3 packages delivered in 93 steps
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging and Troubleshooting

### **If Tests Fail**

#### **Java Compilation Issues**
```bash
# Check Java compatibility
python3 check_java.py

# Manual compilation
javac --release 11 -d bin -cp .:lib/* secondSimulation/simulator/*.java
```

#### **Simulation Debugging**
```bash
# Run debug simulation for detailed output
python3 debug_simulation.py

# Run single simulation manually
java -cp bin:lib/* simulator.MySimFactory
```

#### **Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **"UnsupportedClassVersionError"**
   - **Solution:** Run `python3 check_java.py` to fix Java compatibility

2. **"Simulation appears stuck"**
   - **Cause:** Pathfinding issues or infinite loops
   - **Solution:** Check robot movement patterns in debug output

3. **"No packages delivered"**
   - **Cause:** Battery management or coordination issues
   - **Solution:** Review battery levels and charging behavior

4. **"FileNotFoundException"**
   - **Cause:** Missing configuration files
   - **Solution:** Ensure `secondSimulation/parameters/` files exist

### **Performance Analysis**

#### **View Results**
```bash
# Results are automatically saved to:
cat simulation_results.json

# View generated plots:
# - robot_optimization_results.png
# - robot_efficiency_results.png
```

#### **Interpret Results**
- **Steps:** Lower numbers indicate better efficiency
- **Success Rate:** Should be 100% for all configurations
- **Patterns:** Look for optimal robot counts and efficiency trends
